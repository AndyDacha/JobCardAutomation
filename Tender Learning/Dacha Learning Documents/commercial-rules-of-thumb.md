## Commercial rules of thumb (internal)

This document is for internal estimating and pricing consistency only.

- Pricing outputs for tender submissions should be **sell price only**.
- Do not state or reveal markup percentages in tender submissions unless the ITT explicitly requests it.

### Typical allowances (examples)

- **Default markup assumption**: 40% (internal working assumption; not shown in tender outputs).
- **Training**: allow time for end-user/operator training and handover sessions.
- **Commissioning**: allow time for commissioning, testing, soak/validation where required, and final sign-off.
- **Engineer labour**: include travel time and on-site time (subject to the tender’s pricing model and response SLAs).
- **Travel / accommodation**: include accommodation and subsistence allowances where multi-day or remote attendance is likely.

### Notes

- Use these as starting assumptions; always align to the ITT pricing schedules and the client’s commercial instructions.
